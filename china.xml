                <p>After the American Revolution ended, a Philadelphia financier in 1784 sent the
                    ship <hi rend="italic">Empress of China</hi> for the first voyage of direct
                    trade between the United States and China. In the 60 years following the <hi
                        rend="italic">Empress of China’s</hi> voyage, relations among U.S. citizens
                    and Chinese were private and largely commercial. Nevertheless, Sino-American
                    trade grew under the Chinese system that limited foreign traders’ access to a
                    single port city, Guangzhou (Canton). <figure>
